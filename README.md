# Smart-Voice-Assistant-with-ESP-32
Voice-controlled system using ESP32, Android (Kotlin), and Python. Converts speech to text, transmits commands via Wi-Fi, and executes tasks in VS Code. Features real-time speech recognition, IoT integration, and smart automation. Ideal for AI, IoT, and home automation projects.

##  Features  
**Real-time speech recognition & execution**  
**Wi-Fi-based communication between Android → ESP32 → Laptop**  
**Automated control of system applications & tasks**  
**Expandable for AI, IoT, and home automation**  


##  Technologies Used  
- **Android (Kotlin, Kotlin DSL)** → Speech-to-text conversion & Wi-Fi communication  
- **ESP32 (Arduino/PlatformIO)** → Handles Wi-Fi & serial transmission  
- **Python (VS Code/PlatformIO)** → Reads serial data & executes system commands

##  Installation & Setup Guide  

### **1) Android App (Speech-to-Text & Wi-Fi Communication)**  
- Clone the `Android_App/` folder.  
- Open in **Android Studio**.  
- Grant **Microphone & Wi-Fi** permissions.  
- Build and run the app on your mobile device.  

### **2️) ESP32 Setup (Wi-Fi & Serial Communication)**  
- Clone the `ESP32_Code/` folder.  
- Open the `.ino` file in **Arduino IDE** (or use PlatformIO in VS Code).  
- Select **ESP32 board**, connect via USB, and **upload the code**.  

### **3️) Python Script (Command Processing in VS Code)**  
- Clone the `Python_Scripts/` folder.  
- Install dependencies (if required):  
  pip install pyserial

## How It Works
- 1️) User speaks a command in the Android app (e.g., "Open YouTube").
- 2️) The app converts speech to text and sends it to ESP32 via Wi-Fi.
- 3️) ESP32 receives the command and transmits it to the laptop via a serial connection.
- 4️) Python script on the laptop reads the command and executes the corresponding system task.
